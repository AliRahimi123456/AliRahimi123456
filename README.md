Hi, my name is Ali Rahimi. I am a passionate software engineer with a deep interest in making games and reading books. These hobbies give me energy and motivate me to strive for excellence and continually push my limits.

One of the contributions I am most proud of is opening a school for homeless people in Indonesia. Currently, more than 180 students are enrolled, and I remain actively involved in its operations. I have had the privilege of teaching the students basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, equipping them with valuable skills for their future.


If you're looking for guidance or help in the communities I'm involved with, here's what you can do:

Reach Out Directly: Don't hesitate to contact me via email or social media. I'm always open to helping others and sharing what I've learned.
Join Community Forums: Participate in forums and discussion groups related to software development and education. These platforms are great for asking questions, sharing resources, and connecting with like-minded individuals.
Attend Workshops and Meetups: Engaging in local or online workshops and meetups can provide valuable learning opportunities and networking with other professionals.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance. I'm here to support and empower our community.
